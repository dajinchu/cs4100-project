# Elevator Pitch

Train a single Q-learner to play Othello at varying game board sizes.

# Topics

1 pt: Evaluating your approach in a well-established environment or problem with nontrivial setup, such as the OpenAI Gym.
3 pt: Implementing your own Q-learner with neural network or gradient descent for the backend

# Context/Tools

I will use OpenAI Gym and import one of the several third-party Othello environments ([like this one](https://github.com/pigooosuke/gym_reversi)). I will likely modify the environment to support variable sized boards.
